INTRODUCTION:
A game of logic, thinking and rules, Sudoku has always been a favorite for people who read a lot of newspaper 
and play the games in it. While newspapers have faded away somewhat with the passage of time, we have decided
to bring a beloved game of our childhoods back to life that people of all ages, young and inquisitive as well
as old and wise, can enjoy

HOW TO START:
As this is a JAva application, so one would require Java to play this game. The use of an IDE such as Eclipse,
Netbeans etc. is also recommended for an easy user experience. In order to start, extract the code.rar file
provided in the folder and use an IDE to access the folder. After the folder shows up in the IDE of your 
choosing, go to the Main.java file. Right click on it and run the file in order to start the game.

HOW TO PLAY:

In order to play the game, first the player is asked to select a difficulty. Upon pressing of any of the three 
buttons, the game starts. The player is to select one of the empty boxes and replace them with a number between
1 to 9 by the use of buttons. In addtition to this, after suitable moves have been made according to the player,
they may choose to check their answers by use of the Check button, which keeps the correct answers and removes
the wrong ones. The player must be careful though, as they have limited moves and checks, with their number
varying with difficulty. If the player either wins(completing the grid in time) or loses(number of checks or 
moves decrease to zero), the player is directed to the Game Over window where they can exit the game as well as
see if they have won or not

BUILT WITH:
This project was built with the help of Java, using the Eclipse IDE. The graphical user interface(or GUI) was
made using JavaFX, and the layout was designed using Scene Builder. A css file was also used for styling.
